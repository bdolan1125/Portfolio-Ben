            <h1>const benDolan = "Web Developer"</h1>
            <p>My name is Benjamin Dolan; I'm a web developer based out of Phoenix, Arizona. I'm a high energy, go-getter with a love for critical thinking and creating solutions! After high school, I spent 14 years working in the restaurant industry. In time I attained a  General Manager position, something I had dreamt of for many years! Alas, all that glitters isn't gold. Soon after, the realization came I had chased a hollow dream. My success felt empty and I began dreading the next 20 years. It became clear I'd have to make a change or live in regret forever. I quit my job, enrolled in a Bootcamp, and began doing what I love to do the most! Learn!</p> 
            <br>
            <p>When I'm not actively engaged in a coding session, one will usually still find me seated squarely behind my monitor locked into a heated match of Magic The Gathering: Arena or scrounging for loot in Escape From Tarkov. However, a man can't live on a computer alone! On the weekends expect to find me at the local paintball field, hiking a mountain trail, or hitting the gym for some leg day! I hope to maximize the potential of future coding teams by bringing the skills I developed in restaurant management. </p>
